Machine Learning in NeuroImaging: what and why
===============================================

Machine learning problems and vocabulary
-----------------------------------------

Machine learning is interested in learning empirical rules from data to
make **predictions**. Two kinds of problems appear:

:Supervised learning:

    :ref:`supervised_learning` is interested in predicting an **output
    variable**, or **target**, `y`, from **data** `X`. Typically, we start
    from labeled data (the **training set**) for which we know the `y`
    for each instance of `X` and train a model; this model is then
    applied to new unlabeled data (the **test set**) to predict the
    labels. It may be:
    
    * a **regression** problem: predicting a continuous quantity such 
      as age
    
    * a **classification** problem: predicting the class each 
      observation belongs to, such as patient or control

    In neuroimaging, supervised learning is typically used to relate
    brain images to behavioral or clinical observations.

:Unsupervised learning:

    :ref:`unsupervised_learning` is concerned with data `X` without any
    labels. It analyzes the structure of a dataset, for instance
    **clustering** or extracting latent factors such as independent
    components.

    In neuroimaging, it is typically used to study resting state, or to
    find sub-populations in diseases.


Why is machine learning relevant to NeuroImaging: a few examples
-----------------------------------------------------------------

:Diagnosis and prognosis:

    Predicting a clinical score from brain imaging with :ref:`supervised
    learning <Supervised_learning>` e.g. `[Mourao-Miranda 2012]
    <http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029482>`_

:Generalization scores:

    * Information mapping: using the prediction accuracy of a classifier
      to test links between brain images and stimuli. (e.g.
      :ref:`searchlight <searchlight>`) `[Kriegeskorte 2005]
      <http://www.pnas.org/content/103/10/3863.short>`_

    * Transfer learning: measuring how much an estimator trained on a
      task generalizes to another task (e.g. discriminating left from
      right eye movements also discriminates additions from subtractions
      `[Knops 2009]
      <http://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5934/1583.short>`_)

:Statistical estimation:

    From a statistical point of view, machine learning implements
    statistical estimation of models with a large number of parameters.
    The tricks pulled in machine learning (e.g. regularization) can
    make this estimation possible with a small number of observations
    `[Varoquaux 2012] <http://icml.cc/discuss/2012/688.html>`_. This
    usage of machine learning requires some understanding of the models.

:Data mining:

    Data-driven exploration of brain images. :ref:`unsupervised_learning`
    extracts structure from the data, such as `clusters
    <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html>`_ or
    `multivariate decompositions
    <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html>`_
    (*latent factors* such as ICA). This may be useful for implementing
    some form of *density estimation*: learning a probabilistic model of
    the data (e.g. in `[Thirion 2009]
    <http://www.springerlink.com/content/7377x70p5515v778/>`_).

Installation
=============

.. warning::

   nilearn is an un-released package. It lacks functionality and
   documentation, may have bugs, and will change in the future.
   Nonetheless, we strive to ensure its quality and hope that it may be
   useful in its current state, for technically-savvy users.

Installing the environment
---------------------------

Python scientific stack
........................

We recommend that you **install a complete scientific Python
distribution**, and not download the bare Python.

Indeed, the scientific Python tool stack is rich. Installing the
different packages needed one after the other takes a lot of time and is
error prone.

:Windows:
  EPD_, Anaconda_, or `PythonXY <http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_:
  these distributions come with scikit-learn installed (do make sure
  to install the full, non-free, EPD and not EPD-free to get
  scikit-learn).

:MacOSX:
  EPD_ and Anaconda_ are the only full scientific Python distributions for
  Mac (once again, you need to install the full, non-free, EPD and not
  EPD-free to get scikit-learn).

:Linux:
  While EPD_ and Anaconda_ are available for Linux, most recent linux
  distributions come with the packages that are needed for this tutorial.
  Ask your system administrator to install, using the distribution
  package manager, the following packages:

    - scikit-learn (sometimes called `sklearn`, or `python-sklearn`)
    - matplotlib (sometimes called `python-matplotlib`)
    - ipython
    - nibabel (sometimes called `python-nibabel`)

.. _EPD: http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php

.. _Anaconda: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/

Nibabel: reading neuroimaging files
....................................

`Nibabel <http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nibabel/>`_ is an easy to use
reader of NeuroImaging data files. It is not included in scientific
Python distributions, but is required for all parts of this tutorial.
You can install it with the following command::

  $ pip install -U --user nibabel

If you are under linux, your package manager might have nibabel, for
instance called `python-nibabel`.

.. warning::

   Note that this is a "shell" command, that you need to type in a
   command prompt, and not a Python command.

Installing nilearn
-------------------

Nilearn is unreleased. You can download the latest development snapshot
from the following link:

    https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/archive/master.zip

Unzip it, and run in the resulting directory (as a shell command, once
again)::

    $ python setup.py install --user    

To test if you have done everything right, open IPython and try the
following, in the Python prompt::

    In [1]: import nilearn

If you do not get any errors, you have installed nilearn correctly.

Python for NeuroImaging: a quick-start
==========================================

If you don't know Python, **Don't panic. Python is easy**. Here, we give
the basics to help you get started. For a full blown introduction to
using Python for science, see the `scipy lecture notes
<http://scipy-lectures.github.io/>`_.


We will be using `IPython <http://ipython.org>`_, in pylab mode, which
provides an interactive scientific environment. Start it with::

    $ ipython -pylab

(depending on your ipython version, you may need to use the ``--pylab``
flag instead).

It's interactive::

    Welcome to pylab, a matplotlib-based Python environment
    For more information, type 'help(pylab)'.

    In [1]: 1 + 2*3
    Out[1]: 7

.. topic:: **Prompt**
   
   Below we'll be using `>>>` to indicate input lines If you wish to copy
   these input lines directly into your *IPython* console without
   manually excluding each `>>>`, you can enable `Doctest Mode` with the
   command ::
   
        %doctest_mode

Scientific computing with Python
---------------------------------

Basic numerics
...............

In Python, to get scientific features, you need to import the relevant
libraries:

:Numerical arrays:

  ::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> t = np.linspace(1, 10, 2000)  # 2000 points between 1 and 10
    >>> t
    array([  1.        ,   1.00450225,   1.0090045 , ...,   9.9909955 ,
             9.99549775,  10.        ])
    >>> t / 2
    array([ 0.5       ,  0.50225113,  0.50450225, ...,  4.99549775,
            4.99774887,  5.        ])
    >>> np.cos(t) # Operations on arrays are defined in the numpy module
    array([ 0.54030231,  0.53650833,  0.53270348, ..., -0.84393609,
           -0.84151234, -0.83907153])
    >>> t[:3] # In Python indexing is done with [] and starts at zero
    array([ 1.        ,  1.00450225,  1.0090045 ])

Scikit-learn: machine learning in Python
.........................................

.. topic:: What is scikit-learn?

    `Scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_ is a Python library for machine
    learning. Its strong points are:

    - Easy to use and well documented
    - Computationally efficient
    - Provides a wide variety of standard machine learning methods for non-experts

The core concept in the `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_ is the
estimator object, for instance an SVC (`support vector classifier
<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html>`_).
It is first created with the relevant parameters::

    >>> from sklearn.svm import SVC
    >>> svc = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.)

These parameters are detailed in the documentation of
the object: in IPython you can do::

    In [3]: SVC?
    ...
    Parameters
    ----------
    C : float or None, optional (default=None)
        Penalty parameter C of the error term. If None then C is set
        to n_samples.

    kernel : string, optional (default='rbf')
        Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm.
        It must be one of 'linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid', 'precomputed'.
        If none is given, 'rbf' will be used.
    ...

Once the object is created, you can fit it on data, for instance here we
use a hand-written digits dataset, which comes with scikit-learn::

    >>> from sklearn import datasets
    >>> digits = datasets.load_digits()
    >>> data = digits.data
    >>> labels = digits.target

Let's use all but the last 10 samples to train the SVC::

    >>> svc.fit(data[:-10], labels[:-10])   # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    SVC(C=1.0, ...)

and try predicting the labels on the left-out data::

    >>> svc.predict(data[-10:])
    array([5, 4, 8, 8, 4, 9, 0, 8, 9, 8])
    >>> labels[-10:]    # The actual labels
    array([5, 4, 8, 8, 4, 9, 0, 8, 9, 8])

<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html>`_.
