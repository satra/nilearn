Supervised learning
====================

`Supervised learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning>`_
is focused on predicting an output value. In NeuroImaging it is often
used in the context of *decoding*: predicting behavior from brain images.
It may also be useful for diagnostic.

.. note::

   This section describes advanced supervised learning patterns with
   nilearn. For a fast and easy introduction to *decoding*, see
