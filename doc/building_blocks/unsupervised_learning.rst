Unsupervised learning
=====================

`Unsupervised learning
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning>`_ is focused on
finding structure in a given data. In NeuroImaging two common tasks are
clustering and finding meaningful components (e.g. using ICA).

The technical documentation on unsupervised-learning with nilearn is not
written yet. In the mean time, you can have a look at the relevant
sections in the high-level part of the documentation on neuroimaging
applications:

* :ref:`parcellating_brain`

* :ref:`extracting_rsn`

* :ref:`functional_connectomes`

Also, the `scikit-learn unsupervised learning documentation
<http://scikit-learn.com/stable/unsupervised_learning.html>`_ is a useful
reference.
